In this game the player controls a dot with the arrow keys and tries to avoid touching several other dots. If the player is 'Tagged' the game ends. The positions of the enemy dots are reset after a set interval of time passes. This uses Love's getTime function which seems to behave rather sporadically. I don't know why because I really haven't spent much time researching this issue.
