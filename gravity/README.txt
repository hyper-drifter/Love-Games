This game is really a 2-D gravity-like simulation that uses basic Euler-method integration to calculate the trajectories of multiple bodies in a fictional solar system. One can easily alter the initial positions and velocities of the objects by changing their initial values in the load function.

In addition the player can move the 'sun' with the arrow keys.
